    Problem 1: Linear Regression (Maximum Likelihood)
    In this problem, you will implement the linear regression method based upon maximum likelihood (least square).
    w'x + b = y
    You could test the correctness of your code by typing `nosetests -v test1.py` in the terminal.
    Note: please don't use any existing package for linear regression problem, implement your own version.

def compute_Phi(x, p):
    '''
        Compute the design matrix Phi of x for polynoial curve fitting problem.
        We will construct p polynoials a the p features of the data samples.
        The features of each sample, is x^0, x^1, x^2 ... x^(p-1)
        Input:
            x : a vector of samples in one dimensional space, a numpy vector of shape n by 1.
                Here n is the number of samples.
            p : the number of polynomials/features
        Output:
            Phi: the design/feature matrix of x, a numpy matrix of shape (n by p).
